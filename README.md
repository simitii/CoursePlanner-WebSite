Instead of keeping a database of courses, this project aims to get lastest data from the original source(Boun Registration Web Site) whenever a user needs course information since course informations are updated frequently.

However, there is a trick which is to avoid excessive usage of the original source(Boun Registration Web Site) . We achieve that by using request-response-caching mechanism of nginx on the production. We cache request and their corresponding responses for a while(e.g  1hour). This also improves scalability of our server site code.

#Fixed Bugs:
##Hidden Departments: Some courses appear with sub-department code. Since our design aims to access information from shortest path, it uses department code to find courses. However, sub-department should be explored in order to access courses with sub-department code. Solution is to explore departments and store sub-department codes in the memory and repeat this process after a while (e.g. every 72 hours).

##Multiple Departments with same department code
